## Description
This app **fetches Rick and Morty's episodes**, from the [Rick And Morty public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com), and displays them on a list. When the user taps on an episode a collection-view appears **showing all the corresponding characters in that episode, split into dead or alive, and sorted in the order in which they were created**. If the user taps on a character then a screen showing the characterâ€™s picture and information pops up.

Finally there is an additional functionality that **allows the user to kill characters** and everything in the model is updated accordingly.
